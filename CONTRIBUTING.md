## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

## Release

To release a new version:

1. Run `bin/setup && bin/rake` as a tests, coverage, & linting sanity check
2. update the version number in `version.rb`
3. Run `bin/setup && bin/rake` again as a secondary check, and to update `Gemfile.lock`
4. Double check the `CHANGELOG.md`, make sure changes are documented
5. run `git commit -am "🔖 Prepare release v<VERSION>"` to commit the changes
6. Run `git push` to trigger the final CI pipeline before release, & merge PRs
7. Run `git checkout main` (Or whichever branch is considered `trunk`, e.g. `master`)
8. Run `git pull origin main` to ensure you will release the latest trunk code.
9. Run `bundle exec rake build`
10. Run `bin/checksum` to create and commit the SHA256 & SHA512 checksums
11. Run `bundle exec rake release`

NOTE: You will need to have a public key in `certs/`, and list your cert in the
`gemspec`, in order to sign the new release.
