## Contributing

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at [https://github.com/pboling/gem_bench][🚎src-main].
This project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration, and contributors are expected to adhere to
the [code of conduct][🤝conduct].

To submit a patch, please fork the project and create a patch with tests. Once you're happy with it send a pull request
and you might also post a message to the [gitter chat][🏘chat].

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies.
Then, run `bin/rake` to run the default rake tasks, which include specs.
You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

## Release

### One-time, Per-developer, Setup

**IMPORTANT**: Your public key for signing gems will need to be picked up by the line in the
`gemspec` defining the `spec.cert_chain` (check the relevant ENV variables there),
in order to sign the new release.
See: [RubyGems Security Guide][🔒️rubygems-security-guide]

### To release a new version:

1. Run `bin/setup && bin/rake` as a tests, coverage, & linting sanity check
2. Update the version number in `version.rb`
3. Run `bin/setup && bin/rake` again as a secondary check, and to update `Gemfile.lock`
4. Run `git commit -am "🔖 Prepare release v<VERSION>"` to commit the changes
5. Run `git push` to trigger the final CI pipeline before release, & merge PRs
   - NOTE: Remember to [check the build][🧪build]!
6. Run `export GIT_TRUNK_BRANCH_NAME="$(git remote show origin | grep 'HEAD branch' | cut -d ' ' -f5)" && echo $GIT_TRUNK_BRANCH_NAME`
7. Run `git checkout $GIT_TRUNK_BRANCH_NAME`
8. Run `git pull origin $GIT_TRUNK_BRANCH_NAME` to ensure you will release the latest trunk code
9. Set `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` so `rake build` and `rake release` use same timestamp, and generate same checksums
   - Run `export SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=$EPOCHSECONDS && echo $SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`
   - If the echo above has no output, then it didn't work.
   - Note that you'll need the `zsh/datetime` module, if running `zsh`.
   - In `bash` you can use `date +%s` instead, i.e. `export SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=$(date +%s) && echo $SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`
10. Run `bundle exec rake build`
11. Run `bin/checksums` (more [context][🔒️rubygems-checksums-pr]) to create SHA-256 and SHA-512 checksums
    - Checksums will be committed automatically by the script, but not pushed
12. Run `bundle exec rake release` which will create a git tag for the version,
    push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org][💎rubygems]
